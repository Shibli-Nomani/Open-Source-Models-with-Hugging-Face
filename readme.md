##### 👤 Human Speech Recording: 16,000 Hz
##### 📡 Walkie Talkie/Telephone: 8,000 Hz
##### 🔊 High Resolution Audio: 192,000 Hz

### 📌 key note for Audio Signal Processing:

For 5 sec of video, **SIGNAL VALUE** is (5 x 8000) = 40,000

In case of transformers, the **SIGNAL VALUE** relies on 🔆 Sequences and 🔆 Attention Mechanism..
**SIGNAL VALUE** will look like 60 secs for 1 secs.

In the case of transformers, particularly in natural language processing tasks, the **SIGNAL VALUE** is determined by the length of the 🔆input sequences and the 🔆 attention mechanism employed. Unlike traditional video processing, where each frame corresponds to a fixed time interval, in transformers, the **SIGNAL VALUE** may appear to be elongated due to the attention mechanism considering sequences of tokens. For example, if the attention mechanism processes 60 tokens per second, the **SIGNAL VALUE** for 1 second of input may appear equivalent to 60 seconds in terms of processing complexity.


In natural language processing, the **input sequence** refers to a series of tokens representing words or characters in a text. The **attention mechanism in transformers** helps the model focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during processing by **assigning weights to each token**, allowing the model to **prioritize important information**. Think of it like giving more attention to key words in a sentence while understanding its context, aiding in tasks like translation and summarization.

### 🤗 Task-09: Image to Text Retrieval 

- **🌐📸🔊 Multimodal**

Multimodal models 🌐📸🔊 are machine learning architectures designed to process and integrate information from multiple modalities, such as text, images, audio, and other data types, into a cohesive representation. These models utilize various techniques like `fusion mechanisms`, `attention mechanisms`, and `cross-modal learning` to capture rich interactions between different modalities, enabling them to perform tasks like image captioning, video understanding, and more, by leveraging the complementary information present across different modalities.

- Fusion mechanisms 🔄: Techniques to combine information from different modalities, like averaging features from text and images to make a unified representation.

- Attention mechanisms 👀: Mechanisms that focus on relevant parts of each modality's input, like attending to specific words in a sentence and regions in an image.

- Cross-modal learning 🧠💡: Learning strategies where information from one modality helps improve understanding in another, like using audio features to enhance image recognition accuracy.

**🚵 Application:** ChatGPT --> SEE, HEAR AND SPEAK

#### Libraries Installation

`!pip install transformers`

`!pip install torch`

- **AutoProcessor 📊🤖** is a comprehensive tool developed by Salesforce AI Research to automate and streamline data processing tasks 🛠️. It efficiently handles data extraction, transformation, and loading processes, accelerating data-driven decision-making and improving operational efficiency across various domains such as sales, marketing, and customer service.

#### 🛠️ pt stands for pytorch

```
inputs = processor(images = raw_images,
                   text = text,
                   return_tensors = "pt"
        )
```

#### 🚴 Code Snippits: 


```
itm_scores = model(**inputs)[0]
```

- model(**inputs): This calls the model with the provided inputs. The **inputs syntax in Python unpacks the dictionary inputs and passes its contents as keyword arguments to the model function.

- [0]: This accesses the first element of the output returned by the model. The output is likely a tuple or a list containing various elements, and [0] retrieves the first element.

- itm_scores: This assigns the result obtained from step 2 to the variable itm_scores, which likely contains the predicted scores for different classes.

**📌 note:** To open a raw image

- images.jpg (image name with directory)
  

```
raw_image = Image.open("images.jpg")
raw_image
```
